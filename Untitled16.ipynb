        "Ensemble learning is a method where we use many small models instead of just one. Each of these models may not be very strong on its own, but when we put their results together, we get a better and more accurate answer. It's like asking a group of people for advice instead of just one person—each one might be a little wrong, but together, they usually give a better answer.\n",
        "# Fundamental Idea Behind Ensemble Techniques:\n",
        "The fundamental idea behind ensemble techniques is to combine the predictions of multiple models to improve the overall performance, robustness, and accuracy of the predictions. Ensemble methods leverage the strengths of individual models to reduce errors and enhance generalization by mitigating the weaknesses of any single model.Ensemble techniques are methods in machine learning that combine the predictions of multiple models to produce a more accurate, robust, and generalizable outcome. The core idea is based on the principle that a group of \"weak learners\" can be combined to create a \"strong learner\".\n",
        "# Key Aspects of Ensemble Techniques:\n",
        "1. Combining Multiple Models:\n",
        "Instead of relying on a single model for predictions, ensemble methods aggregate predictions from multiple models.\n",
        "2. Reducing Errors:\n",
        "By combining models, ensemble techniques aim to reduce overfitting (variance reduction) and/or improve accuracy by focusing on reducing bias.\n",
        "3. Improving Generalization:\n",
        "Ensembles often lead to better performance on unseen data compared to individual models.\n",
        "# Bagging Approach and Objectives:\n",
        "Bagging is an ensemble technique where multiple instances of a model (typically decision trees) are trained on different bootstrap samples of the training data. A bootstrap sample is created by randomly sampling the training dataset with replacement, meaning some instances may be repeated while others might be left out.\n",
        "Approach:\n",
        "1. Bootstrap Sampling:\n",
        "Create multiple subsets of the training data by sampling with replacement.\n",
        "2. Model Training:\n",
        "Train a model (often a decision tree) on each bootstrap sample.\n",
        "3. Aggregation of Predictions:\n",
        "- For classification: Predictions from each model are combined via majority voting.\n",
        "- For regression: Predictions are averaged to get the final output.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objectives:\n",
        "1. Reduce Variance: Bagging primarily aims to reduce the variance of the predictions, leading to more stable and robust models.\n",
        "2. Improve Accuracy and Generalization: By averaging predictions from multiple models trained on different subsets, bagging reduces the risk of overfitting.\n",

        "1. Initial Model Training: Start with a simple model (often a decision tree with few splits).\n",
        "2. Iterative Model Building: Train subsequent models focusing on the errors (residuals) of the previous models.\n",
        "3. Weighting Models: Each model is given a weight based on its performance (more accurate models get higher weights).\n",
        "4. Combining Predictions: Final prediction is made by combining predictions from all models, weighted by their performance.\n",

The process involves training a model with training data and then evaluating it. The next model is built on this which tries to correct the errors present in the first model. This procedure is continued and models are added until either the complete training data set is predicted correctly or predefined number of iterations is reached whereas Gradient Boosting is a boosting algorithm and here each new model is trained to minimize the loss function such as mean squared error or cross-entropy of the previous model using gradient descent. In each iteration the algorithm computes the gradient of the loss function with respect to predictions and then trains a new weak model to minimize this gradient. Predictions of the new model are then added to the ensemble (all models prediction) and the process is repeated until a stopping criterion is met.\n",
